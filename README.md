# iMoT: Inertial Motion Transformer for Indoor Navigation

The official paper link will be provided here as soon as it becomes available.

This is the official repository for the paper: "iMoT: Inertial Motion Transformer for Indoor Navigation", accepted at AAAI 2025. This paper introduces an innovative inertial transformer architecture designed to model human motion uncertainties across velocity segments in a multimodal learning manner, thereby significantly enhancing trajectory reconstruction. Typically, during encoding, we first present Progressive Decoupler Series (PDS) to break down complex IMU signals into more interpretable components, facilitating the capture of specific motion patterns. Following this, we design Adaptive Positional Encoding (APE), a flexible and relaxed positional encoding mechanism that effectively learns discrepancies between tokens based on modality content. In addition, inspired by the Particle Filter, we introduce a set of learnable query motion particles corresponding to specific motion modes, which are progressively adjusted during the decoding steps to explain uncertainties in motion.
